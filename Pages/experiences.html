        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a multi-instrumentalist that has been writing, recording, and performing original music since 2003. Some of my compositions have been featured on TV networks such as MTV, Bravo TV, Discovery Channel, and USA. Examples of my work can be heard on shows such as Catfish, Invite Only:Cabo,  A Haunting, WWE, and many more. After graduating as Valedictorian and receiving a Bachelor’s Degree of Music Production/Composition from Full Sail University in 2016, I decided to design and build my own recording studio called Uptown Sound Productions. Since then, I have recorded, mixed, and mastered hundreds of recordings for national and local clientele.</p>
        <p>I’ve been a professional audio engineer for the last five years and am looking to get into something different. I am extremely excited that I found a passion for coding and am very eager to see where it takes me. Let the adventure begin!   </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal is to become a full-stack software developer so I can build applications that ultilze my music background/knowledge. I want to become fluent in languages like:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>C#</li>
          <li>C++</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I’d like to work for a company that builds easy-to-use software for musicians so they can quickly compose and record their ideas to let their creativity flourish.</p>
